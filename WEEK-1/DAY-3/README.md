## Combinational and Sequential optimizations

## Introduction to optimizations

optimization is the scientific discipline of choosing the best element from a set of available alternatives. It's about making something as effective or functional as possible, given a set of constraints.

In more formal, mathematical terms, optimization involves:
Maximizing or Minimizing a specific quantity called the objective function (e.g., profit, cost, efficiency, error).
By systematically choosing the values of decision variables (e.g., how much product to make, which route to take).
Subject to a set of constraints (e.g., limited resources, physical laws, budget limits).
