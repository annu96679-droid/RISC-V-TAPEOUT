#  Fundamentals of STA (Static Timing Analysis) 

Static Timing Analysis (STA) is a crucial process in digital circuit design used to verify the timing performance of a design without requiring simulation vectors. It analyzes all possible paths in the circuit to ensure that the data signals propagate through logic elements within the required time constraints defined by the clock.

During STA, the designâ€™s netlist, timing constraints, and cell library information (which contain delay values of gates and interconnects) are used. The tool computes arrival times (the actual time a signal reaches a point) and required times (the latest time by which a signal must arrive) for all timing paths, and the difference between them is known as slack. A positive slack indicates the design meets timing requirements, while a negative slack means timing violations exist.
