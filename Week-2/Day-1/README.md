# What is System On Chip (SOC)?

 A system on a chip is “simply” every element of a computer on a single integrated circuit. However, in general, SoCs cannot accommodate enough memory for a full operating system such as Linux or Android and, thus, some external memory must be provided, often on top of the SoC itself.

 A System on Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines all the essential components of a computer or embedded system onto a single chip. Unlike traditional computer systems where the CPU, memory, peripherals, and interfaces are separate chips, in an SoC, everything is on the same silicon die.
